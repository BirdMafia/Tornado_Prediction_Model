# Tornado Prediction Model 🌪️

Welcome to the **Tornado Prediction Model** project! This site provides an overview of how we built a machine learning pipeline to forecast tornado intensity in Tornado Alley.

---

## 🚀 About the Project
This project uses **PyTorch**, **scikit-learn**, and advanced feature engineering techniques to predict tornado intensity (EF scale). We processed over 70 years of tornado data to create a reliable ML pipeline.

---

## 🔑 Key Highlights
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and optimized data from 1950–2023.
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Visualization:** Feature importance and classification performance metrics.
- **Deployment Ready:** Pipeline can be adapted for real-time forecasting.

---

## 📊 Dataset
We used the **1950-2023_actual_tornadoes.csv** dataset, enriched with time-based and geographical features.
